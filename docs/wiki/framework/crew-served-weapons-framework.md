## 1. Making a new Crew Served Weapon

### 1.1 CfgVehicles

```cpp
class CfgVehicles {
    class LandVehicle;
    class StaticWeapon: LandVehicle {
        class ACE_Actions;
    };
    class StaticMGWeapon: StaticWeapon {
        class Turrets {
            class MainTurret;
        };
        class ACE_Actions: ACE_Actions {
            class ACE_MainActions;
        };
    };
    class banana_csw: StaticMGWeapon {
        class ace_csw {
            enabled = 1; // whether or not the weapon is affected by CSW                
            proxyWeapon = QGVAR(HMG_Static); // The weapon that will be added to the CSW on initialization. Used to ensure lower ammo-reload time when using Ammo Handling
            magazineLocation = "_target selectionPosition 'magazine'"; // The location of the magazine. Where the action for ammo-handling will appear on the weapon
            disassembleWeapon = QGVAR(staticHMGCarry); // What the weapon will disassemble to
            disassembleTurret = QGVAR(m3TripodLow); // Which tripod will appear when weapon has been disassembled
            ammoLoadTime = 7; // How long it takes in seconds to load ammo into the weapon           
            ammoUnloadTime = 5; // How long it takes in seconds to unload ammo from the weapon
            disassembleFunc = "myCoolFunction.sqf"; // A callback function for when the CSW gets disassembled. Arguments: [tripod, staticWeapon]
        };
    };
};
```

### 1.2 CfgMagazines

```cpp
class CfgMagazines {
    class 100Rnd_127x99_mag; // Example magazine used - does not have to be this
    class banana_ammo: 100Rnd_127x99_mag {
        scope=2; // Needs to be 2 to make sure it shows up in Arsenal
        type=256; // Must be 256 to show up in Arsenal
        count = 100; // How much ammo gets added per "Load Ammo" selection
        model = "\A3\Structures_F_EPB\Items\Military\Ammobox_rounds_F.p3d"; // default ammo box model
    };
};
```

### 1.3 CfgWeapons

```cpp
class CfgWeapons {
    class ace_csw_base_carry;
    class banana_carry_weapon: ace_csw_base_carry {
        class ace_csw_options {
            assembleTo = "banana_csw"; // What the weapon will assemble into
            baseTripod = "banana_tripod"; // The tripod which the weapon can be assembled onto (Default is "ace_csw_m3Tripod")
            type = "weapon"; // What type of carry it is. Must always be "weapon" for the carry weapon
        };
    };
    
    class HMG_Static;
    class banana_weapon: HMG_Static {
        class ace_csw_options {
            deployTime = 10; // Time in seconds it takes to mount the weapon on the tripod
            pickupTime = 12; // Time in seconds it takes to dismount the weapon from the tripod
        };
        magazines[] = { banana_ammo }; // You must have both the dummy and real ammunition
    };
};
```

### 1.4 CfgMagazineGroups

```cpp
    class ace_csw_groups { // Ammo that can be loaded into this CSW
        class banana_ammo { // The magazine which will be loaded into the weapon
            banana_dummy_ammo = 1; // Ammo that is loaded into the weapon as per CfgWeapons >> weapon >> magazines
        };
        
        // Optional
        class ace_csw_100Rnd_127x99_mag { // default magazine that CSW already implements
            banana_dummy_ammo = 1;
        };
        
        /*
          Ammo types already defined by CSW:
            - ace_csw_100Rnd_127x99_mag
            - ace_csw_50Rnd_127x108_mag
            - ace_csw_20Rnd_20mm_G_belt
            - ACE_1Rnd_82mm_Mo_HE
            - ACE_1Rnd_82mm_Mo_Smoke
            - ACE_1Rnd_82mm_Mo_Illum
            - ACE_1Rnd_82mm_Mo_HE_Guided
            - ACE_1Rnd_82mm_Mo_HE_LaserGuided
            - Titan_AT
            - Titan_AA
        */
    };
```

## 2. Making a new Tripod

### 2.1 CfgVehicles

```cpp
class CfgVehicles {
    class ace_csw_baseTripod;
    class banana_tripod: ace_csw_baseTripod {
        class ace_csw { disassembleTo = "banana_carry_tripod"; }; // What will be spawned when "Pickup Tripod" is selected
    };
};
```

### 2.2 CfgWeapons

```cpp
class CfgWeapons {
    class ace_csw_base_carry;
    class banana_carry_tripod: ace_csw_base_carry {
        class GVAR(options) {
                deployTime = 166; // How much time in seconds it takes to deploy the tripod
                pickupTime = 12; // How much time in seconds it takes to pickup the tripod
                type = "mount";  // What type of carry it is. Must always be "mount" for the carry tripod
                deploy = "banana_tripod"; // What will be deployed when "Deploy Tripod" is selected
            };
    };
};
```
