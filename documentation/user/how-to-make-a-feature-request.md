### Before requesting

ACE 2, AGM and CSE had a lot of features implemented or planned. All of them are or have been evaluated for inclusion in ACE3 itself, and we'd like to port the majority of them eventually. However, due to time constraints, we have only managed to do a fraction of the job so far.

There's really no point on making feature requests for anything included or planned for inclusion in ACE2, AGM or CSE. The majority of those things are been considered for porting or rewritting already.

<div class="panel callout">
    <h5>Please note:</h5>
    <p>Due to the pace at which development is taking place, we are establishing a feature request embargo during the first week weeks prior and posterior to the first release. Feel free to add feature requests as described below, but don't expect them to be evaluated or discussed yet. Any dev activity on the feature request thread is highly unlikely during that period.</p>

### Requesting a feature

In order not to spam the issue tracker with duplicated requests, we have have created a single <a href="{{ site.githubUrl }}/issues/414/" target="_blank">Issue for feature request</a>. Any and all requests should be done there, where they will get discussed and evaluated. Before posting a new one, please make sure to check the previous entries on the thread and make a quick search; please don't reiterate requests that had already been either accepted for inclusion or disregarded.

Accepted feature requests may be moved to a separate issue by moderators for further discussion.
