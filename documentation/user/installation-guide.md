## 1. Overview
This guide will explain how to get ACE3 up and running faster than you can say banana.

## 2. Prerequisites
- Download [CBA](http://www.armaholic.com/page.php?id=18767).
- Download [ACE3](https://github.com/acemod/ACE3/releases/latest).
- Know how to extract .zip files. Use [Google](https://www.google.com) if not sure.

## 3. Install ACE3
- Extract both CBA and ACE3 .zip files into your Arma 3 folder. By default this is located in:<br>
32-Bit - `C:/Program Files/Steam/Steamapps/Common/Arma 3/`<br>
64-Bit - `C:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/Steamapps/Common/Arma 3/`
- After extraction you should have the `@ace` and `@CBA_A3` folders inside your Arma 3 folder.

## 4. Launch Arma 3 with ACE3
- Launch Arma 3 to start the official game Launcher.
- Click `Mods` and make sure the checkboxes next to `ace` and `CBA_A3` are ticked.
