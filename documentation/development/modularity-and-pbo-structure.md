###  Modularity

Main principles:
- As much stuff as possible should be modular
- Strive to make as much stuff as possible run-time toogable. Adding/removing PBOS would still be requiring to toogle any feature relying on config changes.

### PBO Structure

Main principles:

- Try to keep single module dependencies as much as possible
- InteractionMenu would be the requirement for most modules.
- Anything that is 100% config should require common and not interaction.

```
Main -> Common -> OptionsMenu -> InteractionMenu -> Most things

Main -> Common -> Config things

Main -> Common -> 3D Models      |
                 InteractionMenu | -> Feature
```
