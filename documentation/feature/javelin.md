## 1. Overview
Blah blah blah

Steps to lock titan/Javelin:

1. You must be zoomed ALL THE WAY IN
2. You must be in thermal view
3. You must have a missile loaded
4. Hold TAB over a target, it will start beeping and the constraint boxes will appear
5. Once the beeping changes to LOCK tone, and the lock crosshairs appear, click fire without releasing tab


CTRL+TAB is default key to change firemode (configurable as a key)
