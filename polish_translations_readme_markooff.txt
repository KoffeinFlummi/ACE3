Hi,

as it's my first and very quick translation work for ACE3 mod
some positions may be not as accurate (in polish) as it should be. 
Especially I mean some of the high sophisticated or technical issues
(like laser beam dispersion or some ammunition, barometric or scopes issues).
I tried to translate it as fast and reliable as it can be done in one night
:) but later i plan to do it more accurate 
(I've studied fisics and informatics and I'm working as 
a UNIX/Linux system engineer) 

Additionally , together with my milsim group I used the ACE2 mod
for the last 3 years (I find it the gratest mod for Arma2!),
and now as we plan our migration to Arma3 and,
respectively ACE3 mod, but, as for today I've never used the 
interface of the ACE3 mod by myself and I know that some 
of the isuues (and translations) may change during the normal
use of the mod in game (I may find the better polish translations). 

So, I plan to develop my translations esp in those issues 
which I mentioned above. 

With best wisches for the whole ACE Team
